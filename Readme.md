Formotron processes an array of input data into a user-defined data object.
Validation rules are defined by the data object itself, via property types and
custom attributes.

It is designed for processing form data, but may have other uses as well.

The project is in a very early stage and not yet ready for general purpose
usage. Basic documentation can be found in in the code.
